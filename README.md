# TechSolutions-Website-V1.3.1

The TechSolutions Website is for a Project 

The TechSolutions Website has a login/signup functionality and a an appointment booking functionality

To get started
You will need to have a IDE installed on your system some options are Visual Studio Code, Atom, and WebStorm

Go here to download VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com.

Go to the terminal you can find it on the top navigation bar labeled Terminal and select the first option labeled
"New Terminal" or "CTRL+Alt+T" to open the new terminal.

Now follow the following instructions:

You will need to have Node.js installed on your system use the following command to see if it is installed
node -v

Example:
v18.7.0

If that doesn't work follow these steps:

1. Visit the official Node.js website at https://nodejs.org.

2. On the homepage, you will find the "Downloads" section. Click on the appropriate download button for your operating system.

3. Follow the installation instructions specific to your operating system. The installer will include npm as part of the Node.js installation process.

4. Once the installation is complete, you can repeat the steps mentioned above to check if node is installed.


You will have to have npm installed use the following command to check if it is installed 
npm --version

In my case 9.6.0 is the current version

If not go back up and follow how to download Node.js

Following the previous steps above you must now initialize a new project using

npm init or npm init -y

Using npm init -y will install dependencies but will not work as the "Validator" dependencie requires the package-lock.json

So in this case npm init should be the command used.
